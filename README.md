Project outline: 
I. 1) Estimation of volatility using range-based estimators
   2) Study on the efficiency, precision and stability of each estimator
   3) Prediction of intraday volatility using the GARCH model 

II. 1) Simulation of a Rough volatility process and analysis
    2) Same procedure for real market data 
    3) Study of the autocorrelation structure
    4) Prediction of the intraday volatility using the Rough volatility modeling and analysis 

III. 1) Trading strategy 1: moving average crossover strategy
     2) Trading strategy 2: moving average crossover strategy  including volatilities 
     3) Trading strategy 3: Bollinger Bands strategy
     4) Comparison of the strategies using Sharpe Ratio and Drawdown
